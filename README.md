## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

This repository is a collaborative space for learning and exploring Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts, techniques, and models. It serves as a record of my journey into NLP, starting from the fundamentals and gradually progressing towards more advanced topics like attention models. Feel free to contribute to this repository by adding your own learning materials, suggesting improvements, or opening discussions on specific NLP concepts.

### **Prerequisites**

Must have SpaCy (https://spacy.io/) and Jupyter installed. To install (MacOS/Linux) use the following command:

```
pip3 install spacy && python3 -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

**Content:**

- The repository will be progressively populated with the following materials:
  - **Jupyter Notebooks:** Interactive notebooks demonstrating NLP techniques with code examples and explanations.
  - **Python Scripts:** Standalone Python scripts for specific NLP tasks.
  - **Readme Files:** Detailed explanations of key NLP concepts and approaches.
  - **Additional Resources:** Links to helpful articles, tutorials, and documentation for further exploration.

The content will cover various areas of NLP, including:

- **Text Preprocessing:**
  - Tokenization (splitting text into words or units)
  - Normalization (handling variations of words)
  - Stemming and Lemmatization (reducing words to their base form)
  - Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging (identifying grammatical roles of words)
- **Feature Extraction:**
  - Bag-of-Words (BoW) representation
  - TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) weighting
  - N-grams (sequences of words)
- **Traditional NLP Models:**
  - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and their variants (LSTMs, GRUs)
- **Deep Learning for NLP:**
  - Transformer-based models (e.g., BERT)
  - Attention mechanisms

**Target Audience:**

This repository is intended for anyone interested in learning NLP, from beginners with no prior knowledge to those seeking to refresh their understanding or explore specific topics in more depth. The content will be presented in a way that is accessible and easy to follow, with code examples and explanations tailored for practical implementation.

**Learning Resources:**

The learning materials within this repository will be based on a variety of resources, including:

- Online courses (e.g., Coursera, fast.ai)
- NLP books and tutorials
- Research papers on specific NLP models and techniques

Links to these resources will be documented and referenced throughout the repository to provide users with additional context and opportunities for further exploration.

**Contributions:**

This repository is meant to be a collaborative learning space. Feel free to contribute in the following ways:

- **Add your own Notebooks/Scripts:** Share your NLP learnings and code implementations by creating pull requests.
- **Suggest Improvements:** Raise issues or propose changes to existing content to enhance clarity or accuracy.
- **Open Discussions:** Start discussions on specific NLP topics you're interested in or have questions about.

By working together, we can create a valuable resource for anyone interested in the exciting world of NLP!
