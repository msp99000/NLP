    "# **Natural Language Processing Basics Notebook**\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook explores the fundamentals of Natural Language Processing (NLP). It starts with text preprocessing, a crucial step that involves lexical processing (tokenization, lemmatization, stemming, stop word removal, and POS tagging) to prepare the text data. Then, it dives into feature extraction techniques like Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, and n-grams (unigrams, bigrams, skipgrams) to convert the preprocessed text into a numerical format suitable for machine learning models. Finally, the notebook explores deep learning models for NLP tasks, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with their variants like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and the powerful Transformer-based Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model."

As it bounded through the forest, it caught sight of a dog lounging in a patch of sunlight, completely oblivious to its surroundings. The fox, being the mischievous creature that it is, decided to have a bit of fun. With a sly grin, it gathered its strength and leaped gracefully over the unsuspecting canine. The dog, startled by the sudden movement, let out a yelp of surprise before realizing what had transpired. The fox continued on its way, feeling quite pleased with itself for such a daring feat.\n"
